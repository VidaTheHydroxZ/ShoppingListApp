# ShoppingApp

## Shopping List
Do you often forget what you want to buy? Do you come in the store, grab a cart and you can't remember what you came for?
If that's true, this application is FOR YOU! 
Instead of writing all the groceries you need to buy on a piece of paper, download this app and add groceries on your fully customized list.
You can add groceries that are on sale in different stores and on different days. 
All of the data you enter will persist when you close your app and re-open it as well, since all the data is saved in your database.

## Overview
This repository contains an Android Studio project of a Shopping List application, designed to add groceries you need to buy on a list.
There is a dropdown menu for different stores and different days in the week. The app was originally made for my dad since he wanted an app where he could write all the different groceries that are on sale in each store on each day.

## Features
User-friendly Interface: Easy navigation and interaction through dropdown menus and add buttons for adding groceries.

## Getting Started

You can also clone this repository and check out the application code written in Java or open Android Studio and open this project.
